Development Strategy
1. Create gui that takes input and outputs something
2. Plan out priorities
3. Make "volunteer" class as specified
4. Make system to verify the request is possible
5. Begin the priority assignment (assign break, then rest, make sure two people don't switch spots)

POST: 

Necessary:
- GUI
- Facepainting shifts (teen implementation)
- Full day (two breaks for a volunteer who's marked as full day, preferably adjacent)

Bonus:

 1. Shuffle button - redoes assignment with newly shuffled volunteers
 2. Display vacancies in the schedule
	2b. Highlight particular volunteers
 3. Save event in template file to be loaded
	Load template button, or create new
 4. Create menus for ease of use: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html
	- Load saved templates
	- Clear data
	
IDEAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Represent each timeslot as an array of slots to fill
- Clone a priorityqueue of volunteers for each timeslot, ensure all are assigned
  + Assign highest priority first
- Have a modifiable array of Set<Volunteer> that stores the last person at each station, ensure no swaps
